# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive community. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to create an environment where everyone—regardless of background, identity, or experience—feels safe and valued.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive experience for all, we expect contributors to uphold the following standards:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Use inclusive and welcoming language.
- Accept constructive feedback graciously.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior.
- Show empathy towards others in the community.
- Collaborate in a professional and positive manner.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate any form of harassment, including but not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to personal attributes (such as gender, race, or disability).
- Threats, intimidation, or unwelcome attention.
- Publishing private or sensitive information without consent.
- Disruptive behavior that interferes with the productive engagement of others.

## Enforcement

If you believe someone is violating this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it to the project maintainers. All reports will be reviewed confidentially, and appropriate action will be taken.

## Consequences of Violations

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Repeated or severe violations may result in warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, and community events. It also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces.

## Acknowledgments

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a widely adopted standard for open-source communities.
